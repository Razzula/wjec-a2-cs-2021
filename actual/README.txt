a list of other users is visible bty selecting 'Manage Files' and then selecting 'Users.txt'.

IMPORTANT!!!!
The view timeatable feature is date-sensitive, how this works is:
- any past weeks will display only completed jobs
- future weeks will display only the current timetable
- present weeks will show completed jobs for days that have passed this week, and the current timetable for the present and future day. FOR EXAMPLE, if looking on a Wednesday, Monday and Tuesday's items will only show confirmed bookings. To fully test this, you will need to either look on multiple days, or, change you system's date to experiencethedifference of different days.

(PAST ITEMS ARE A LIGHTER GREY TO HIGHLIGHT THIS)

The 'Job Completed' and 'Day Completed' buttons will save the releveant items as completed, and so will still be visible after the day has ended. Any items not marked will no longer display once the day has ended. NOTE: only the jobs of the current day can be marked as completed.

All files can be found in the default location.
